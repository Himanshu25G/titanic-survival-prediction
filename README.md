# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

This project predicts the survival of passengers on the Titanic using **Machine Learning**.  
It is based on the famous **Titanic dataset** from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that answers the question:  
**“What sorts of people were more likely to survive the Titanic disaster?”**  

Steps followed in this project:
1. **Data Preprocessing** – Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and feature scaling.  
2. **Feature Engineering** – Creating new features such as family size and extracting titles from names.  
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Visualizing patterns and survival trends.  
4. **Model Training** – Using multiple ML algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.).  
5. **Evaluation** – Comparing model accuracy and performance.
